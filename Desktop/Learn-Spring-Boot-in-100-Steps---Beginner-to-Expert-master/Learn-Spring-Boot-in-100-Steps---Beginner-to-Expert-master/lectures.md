## Course Intro

Welcome to this master class on spring boot. We are excited to help you build an awesome web application and a REST API with springboot.

In this, we'will introduce you to the different sections of the course. By the end of this video you should have a clear idea of how to make the best use of this course.

We have organized this course into a number of different sections and we have designed each of these sections to be independent of each other.

That means you have the flexibility of customizing the course based on your skills and your immediate needs.

We have an introduction to the spring framework in the appendix at the end of the course. If you're new to spring or if you want to quickly revise the concepts of spring, we recommend you to start with that section first and then jump into introduction to spring boot.

Let's get a quick overview of some of the important sections:

Section 1 is the introduction section. That's where we are, right now.

Section 2 is a one hour introduction to spring boot. This section is designed for absolute beginners to Spring Boot. You will get a 10,000 feet overview of Spring Boot and some of its important features. As usual, as you expect in in28minutes courses, we take a hands-on approach to learn Spring Boot.

In Section 3, we build a web application end to end with Spring Boot in about 40 steps. You will learn about the fundamentals of building web applications with Spring Boot. You will also learn about Hibernate and JPA. By the end of this section, you will have built a full functional todo management app using Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, Hibernate and MySQL database.

Section 4 and section 5 provide quick introduction to Junit and Mockito. 

Section 6 is where we take a deep dive into spring boot. We try a variety of starter projects and build an API for a survey questionnaire.

If you are new to Spring, you can check out the Introduction to Spring section in the Appendix.

In summary, this is your course. Feel free to create your own path through it and tailor it for your needs.
